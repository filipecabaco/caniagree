# caniagree - WIP
Can I Agree?

PixelsCamp 2017 Project


# launch plan

 1. closed beta, invitation only
 1. open platform
 1. trusted network of advisors, where your trusted contacts' votes have a much higher meaning than the ones from the rest of the community


# future work

 1. Compare between different services, so you can choose, for instance, whether you want to upload your videos to Youtube or Vimeo
 1. Implement the service for software licenses, and also allow for comparison of TOS between different services ("Should I go with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud?"; btw: AWS, 34k words)
 1. Implement the service for legal contracts ("Which Internet provider do I want to go with?"; tip: look for the "responsible use policy" items)

There are also other functionalities we need to work on, namely taking care of updates to TOS and gather different terms from the same product in one place (Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy, etc).


# business plan

We have come up with several ways of monetizing this project; these are our favorite two right now:

 1. Companies may pay to display their services when someone is looking into policies for other similar services
 1. Users may pay for certain comparisons ("Which of these 20 magazines should I try to sell my stories to? What are their terms when it comes to intellectual property?")
